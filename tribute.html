        <ul>
          <li><p>He was then killed by <strong>Megatron</strong>, leader of the <span id="dtc"><strong>Decepticons.</strong></span></p></li>
          <li><p>Alpha Trion rebulit him, thus the great <strong><span id="op">Optimus</span> <span id="po">Prime</span></strong> - leader of the <strong><span id="atb">Autobots</span></strong> - was born.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>1984:</strong> Both sides awoke after 1000 millenials in stasis as an aftermath of crash landing on Earth, began the Great War III.</li>
        <li><strong>2005:</strong> After being heavily wounded at the battle of Autobot City, Optimus Prime passed away, with the Matrix of Leadership handed to Hot Rod.</li>
        <li><strong>2007:</strong> In an effort to get rid of the Hate Plague, Optimus Prime is alive once more.</li>
      </ul>
